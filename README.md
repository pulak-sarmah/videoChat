# Full-Stack Next.js 14 Zoom Clone

This is a fully-fledged video calling application built with [Stream's React Video SDK](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/react/) and Next.js. It includes all features you would expect from a video calling app, like mic & cam controls, roles & permissions, call recordings, screen sharing, picture-in-picture, and more.
